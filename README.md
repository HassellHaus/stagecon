## Development  
- Stagecon is built with flutter and targets macOS, iOS, Windows, Android, and Linux.  Contributions are greatly appreciated as I don't have the manpower to test thoroughly on each platform.
- Please report any bugs on the [issues page](https://github.com/HassellHaus/stagecon/issues)
- I recommend using [QLab](https://qlab.app) to test the software
